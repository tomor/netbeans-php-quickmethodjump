Netbeans Php Quick Method Jump
============================
## About
A very simple Netbeans plugin which was created to offer a quick list and filter
of methods (functions) in currently opened PHP file and jump to the selected one.

## Environment
Current support `NetBeans 8.0`, `NetBeans 7.4`

## Install
You can install the plugin via Tools > Plugins - "Available Plugins"

Or download it from plugin repository http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/52704/ and install it manually
via Tools > Plugins - Downloaded tab - "Add Plugins".

Note: To be able to assign a hot-key you need to restart Netbeans after plugin is installed.

## Usage
- From the menu: Source > Quick Method Jump
- File context menu: Quick Method Jump
- But the best option is to assign a hot-key - I use Ctrl+Shift+M

## Ideas for next version
- move quick method jump from menu "Source" to "Navigate", or maybe remove from menu at all?
