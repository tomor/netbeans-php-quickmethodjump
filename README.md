Netbeans Php Quick Method Jump
============================
## About
A very simple Netbeans plugin which was created to offer a quick list and filter
of methods in currently opened PHP file and jump to the selected one.

## Environment
Current support `NetBeans 7.4`

## Install
Plugin was uploaded to Netbeans plugin repository http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/52704/

Note: To be able to assign a hot-key you need to restart Netbeans after plugin is installed.

- File context menu: Quick Method Jump
- But the best option is to assign a hot-key - I use Ctrl+Shift+M
