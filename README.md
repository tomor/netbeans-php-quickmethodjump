netbeans-php-quickmethodjump
============================
## About
A very simple Netbeans plugin which was created to offer a quick filter of
methods in currently opened PHP file and jump to the selected method.

## Environment
Current support `NetBeans 7.4`

## Install
Plugin was uploaded to Netbeans plugin repository http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/52704/

I recommend to assign a hotkey for "Quick Method Jump" - you want the list of methods
quickly, don't you?

Note: To be able to assign a hot-key you need to restart Netbeans after plugin is installed.

## Howto
You can show the dialog from the menu: Source - Quick Method Jump
You can show the dialog from the file context menu: Quick Method Jump
But the best option is to assign a hot-key - I use Ctrl+Shift+M
