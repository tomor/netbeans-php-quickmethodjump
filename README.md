Netbeans Php Quick Method Jump
============================
## About
A very simple Netbeans plugin which was created to offer a quick list and filter
of methods in currently opened PHP file and jump to the selected one.

## Environment
Current support `NetBeans 7.4`

## Install
You can download the plugin from plugin repository http://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/52704/ and install it
via Tools > Plugins - Downloaded tab - "Add Plugins"

If you want to see this plugin in the "Available Plugins" tab in the Tools > Plugins
currently you have to add url for Experimental 7.4 plugins in the Settings tab in Tools > Plugins
http://plugins.netbeans.org/nbpluginportal/updates/7.4/catalog-experimental.xml

Note: To be able to assign a hot-key you need to restart Netbeans after plugin is installed.

## Usage
- From the menu: Source > Quick Method Jump
- File context menu: Quick Method Jump
- But the best option is to assign a hot-key - I use Ctrl+Shift+M
